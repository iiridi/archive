A starmetal is a metal imbued with magical properties. The name is a misnomer; ancient astergraphs believed that the metals were produced by celestial bodies as a boon for those that orbited around them. This has since been disproven, as starmetals have been artificially manufactured by introducing high quantities of [[Manifestation|mana]] into mundane metals.

Each starmetal has a set of unique properties that make them highly sought after for both jewelry and armament manufacture.

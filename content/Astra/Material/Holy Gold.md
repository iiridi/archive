Holy Gold is a mythical [[Starmetal|starmetal]] found everywhere in the [[Astra/index|Astra]] in exceptionally small quantities. It's said that it appears only by divine providence, and all attempts to manufacture the metal have failed with grievous consequences.

Legendary armaments such as the Godslayer Needles, Excalibur, and Aut's Armamentarium are said to have been produced from enchanted Holy Gold, but rare is the chance that an artifact of that caliber falls in the hands of someone willing to destroy it for proper metallurgic analysis.

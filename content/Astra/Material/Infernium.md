Infernium is a blood-red [[Starmetal|starmetal]] used for weaponry and armor in parts of the [[Astra/index|Astra]]. Infernium does not appear naturally, nor can it be manufactured by any metallurgic processes -- it can only be directly [[Manifestation|manifested]] from the essence of a sentient creature. Traditionally, this process involves removing the essence forcibly from an unwilling "donor," but some people provide their own essence for their supply.

As infernium is manifested, it's unusually compatible with other magical constructs. Weapons made from infernium can sap mana from their targets, and armor can hold more enchantments than average.

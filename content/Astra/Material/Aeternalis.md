Æternalis -- known colloquially as ghost coal -- is a chalky white substance with flecks of green metal embedded throughout. It burns cleanly into a hot, green flame that faintly hums instead of crackling. The ghost coal burns for an extremely long time; famously, a chalice of the stuff has sat (lit) on the steps of [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/Haven/index|Haven]] for years without exhausting its fuel supply. While it isn't a [[Starmetal|starmetal]] itself, it is a precursor in two known starmetal amalgams.

The only known location of æternalis veins in the [[The Occident|Occident]] is within the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/index|Hidden Gulch]], but various interested parties have smuggled out small amounts over the past two decades.

A highly explosive powder that remains stable in transport and is cheap to produce. First discovered this cycle in 662 by artificers in [[Althane/Location/Salores/Toleros/index|Toleros]], its obvious offensive capabilities quickly spread throughout the [[The Occident|Occident]].

Gunpowder is made of aqua fortis stabilized by saltspirit. Saltspirit is easy to come by -- all one needs is a supply of salt and some store of magic energy, but the saltpetre and sulfuric acid needed to manufacture aqua fortis are in short supply. The only known locations of sulfur are in the marshes of [[Althane/Location/Salores/index|Salores]], and saltpetre mines are dotted around the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/index|Lunae Badlands]] south of Toleros.

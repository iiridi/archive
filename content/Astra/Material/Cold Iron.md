Contrary to what the name would imply, cold iron isn't iron at all. Cold iron is a [[Starmetal|starmetal]] alloy developed by some antecyclic civilization that can pierce fey, fiend, and [[Lycan|lycan]] natural protections. While introducing heat can melt cold iron and allow it to be smelted, the metal itself stays at exactly 53Â° no matter what the external temperature is.

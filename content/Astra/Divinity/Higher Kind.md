A Higher Kind is an umbrella term for the beings first born from the primordial singularity at the start of time. Higher Kinds formed before the [[Astra/index|Astra]] was stable enough to form local [[The Weave|Weaves]], so they're tied directly to the underlying [[Astra/Natural Laws/Projection/The Aetheric Field/index|Aetheric Field]].

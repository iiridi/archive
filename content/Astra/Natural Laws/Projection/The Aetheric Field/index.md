The Aetheric field is a non-uniform distribution of energy spread across the entire [[Astra/index|Astra]]. It's the sole source of arcane energy across the Astra (although most tap into the field through a [[The Weave|Weave]] as an intermediary). While the Aether cannot be physically touched, it can be indirectly manipulated -- as specified in the [[Aetheric Laws]].

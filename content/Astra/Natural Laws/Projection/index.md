title: Projection
---
Roughly speaking, the world consists of three overlayed strata. The base layer is the [[Astra/Natural Laws/Projection/The Aetheric Field/index|Aetheric Field]] -- a heterogeneous distribution of energy everywhere across the [[Astra/index|Astra]]. Laid atop that is the [[The Weave|Weave]], an interface layer that provides an energy sink for the aether. Finally, the third layer is the [[YuDaan's Nine-fold Treatise|Enneract]], the space-time-spirit continuum upon which the entire world is built.

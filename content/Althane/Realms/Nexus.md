There are parts of [[Althane/index|Althane]] that are connected to a [[Althane/Realms/index.md|realm]] more deeply than anywhere else. These locations are called nexes, and the area around a particular realm's nexus exhibits the properties of that realm. This includes (but is not limited to) weather patterns, geography, local inhabitants, modifications to regular physics, and emotional responses.

The Starfont is an extrinsic flow of energy that passes through [[Althane/index|Althane]]. It brings with it a flow of [[Manifestation|mana]] not tied to the [[Althane/Realms/index|realms]] or [[Althane/Divinity/index|gods]] native to the sphere. Its flow ebbs and surges seemingly at random, making it a much less reliable source of magic than the light from the realms, and pulling from it is considered heretical by most religious institutions on the planet.

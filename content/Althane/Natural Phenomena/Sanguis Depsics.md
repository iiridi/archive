Sanguis Depsics is the umbrella term for the effects of ingesting [[The Deep|deepblood]]. Unlike the two other major mutative blood diseases on [[Althane/index|Althane]][^1], there are no apparent unifying markers of Sanguis Depsics, and yet it is immediately obvious to others when an "afflicted" is seen.

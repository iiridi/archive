Many believe that the first race to be created by Lacuna was the humans and that many other races on the planet were derived from their original blueprint.

The metahuman ancestries are the [[Dwarf|Dwarves]], [[Elf|Elves]], [[Gnome|Gnomes]], [[Hydren]], [[Kithkin]], [[Umbryl]], and, of course, the [[Human|Humans]].

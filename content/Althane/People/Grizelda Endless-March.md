Grizelda is a middle-aged female [[Orc]]. She managed a small trading caravan that travelled between [[Althane/Location/Salores/index|Salores]] and the small mining towns in the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/index|badlands]].

At a rest-stop taken during her final trip, a Khulakahn ambushed her caravan, killing her three compatriots[^1]. She gave up the trade after the incident.

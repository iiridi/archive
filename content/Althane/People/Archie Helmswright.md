Archie is a friendly middle-aged, [[Dwarf|dwarven]] male with a penchant for launching metal slugs faster than the sound barrier. He owns the [[Hammer and Pin|Hammer & Pin]], which he uses both as a storefront as well as dry storage for his multiple tons of [[Gunpowder|gunpowder]]. If you asked him, he'd say that his best friend is his [[Hester and Sons|Hester & SonsÂ®]] .44 Albatross, due to its high firepower and inability to cheat on him.

Archie is a 4'7" dwarf with a long red beard, a bulbous nose, a shiny, bald head, and a set of ~30 singed overalls that he rotates through.

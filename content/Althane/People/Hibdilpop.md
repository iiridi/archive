Hibdilpop is a middle-aged [[Gnome]] from [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/Haven/index|Haven]]. He's short, even for his ancestry, and has a shock of red hair atop his head (as well as out his ears). Hibdilpop works as a travelling salesman for the [[Honeydew Meadery]], and sells kegs of their beverages to taverns in the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/index|Gulch]] wholesale.

The Crystalpoint Lattice is a multi-dimensional mesh of red, octahedral gemstones suspended in a golden filament. When the Lattice is deep in thought, one can see light move from crystal to crystal in a fashion similar to the current understanding of electrical signals through neurons.

The Lattice is a sentient magical artifact that serves as the head of state of [[Althane/Location/Illyara/index|Illyara]] as well as the prime rector of the [[The Trust|Trust]]. Under its leadership, the city has greatly prospered, gaining a deeper understanding of the technology spread throughout the surrounding ruins more quickly than it would have without the Lattice.

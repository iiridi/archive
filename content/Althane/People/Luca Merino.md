Luca is a researcher with the [[The Trust|Trust]] in [[Althane/Location/Salores/Toleros/index|Toleros]]. He's a foremost expert on [[Resonance Crystal|resonance crystals]], although his days exploring the world for crystal caches is long behind him. Nowadays he spends his time holed up in his small lab in the Mistwatch Arcanum, trying to unravel the mysteries of the [[The Weave|Weave]] and how [[Manifestation|manifestation]] works.

Luca is a gruff old [[Human]] man who has a crick in his back so severe he almost curls in on himself. Straightened out he'd stand near six feet tall, but as it stands he barely hits five.

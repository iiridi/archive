Burr is a female, red-scaled [[Kobold]] of about 10 years. She's originally from [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/Junction/index|Junction]], but [[Anatoli Suvchek]] identified her engineering talents and saved her from a life in the mines.

Burr was mind-controlled by a [[Bioarcanic Engineering|bioarcanically engineered]] creature living in her stuffed animal, and assassinated [[Yantho]]. She has no recollection of the events.

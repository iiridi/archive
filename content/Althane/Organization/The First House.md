The First House is the branch of the [[Althane/Location/Oresk/index|Oreskian]] government dedicated to information dissemination and monitoring. All [[Printing Press|printing presses]] and writing houses are registered with the First House, and the Oreskian post is inspected by members before itâ€™s allowed to be delivered. Ostensibly, the department works to keep state secrets from passing into the hands of their enemies.

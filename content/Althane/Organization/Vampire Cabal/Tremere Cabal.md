The Tremere cabal is a modern family of vampires whom first contracted their strain of [[Sanguis Noxa]] about 200 years ago. The first infected, [[Seraphine Tremere]], is still the matriarch of the family. The family is heavily involved in the politics of [[Althane/Location/Athrea/Thyropae/index|Thyropae]], and controls the majority of the naval trade conducted in the city's ports.

Members of the Tremere cabal must drink the blood of a sentient creature, unwillingly extracted, or suffer increasingly severe maladies that eventually result in death.

The Lone Oak Ranch is a former horse ranch some 30 miles south of [[Althane/Location/Salores/Toleros/index|Toleros]]. It used to be a supplier of horses for those traveling further south into the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/index|Lunae Badlands]], but lack of interest and competition from [[Karpie|karpie]] ranchers drove the place out of business.

The ranch is currently occupied by [[Jake Halloway|Jake "Sureshot" Halloway]] and his posse.

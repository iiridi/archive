La Peiza is a town operated by the [[Red Dragon Rail Company]], built around an ancient well. The town recently suffered a great drought as the water from the well was tainted with some magical ailment. [[The Weft]] descended to the [[Hadal Tap]] within the well and cleared the problem, saving the town.

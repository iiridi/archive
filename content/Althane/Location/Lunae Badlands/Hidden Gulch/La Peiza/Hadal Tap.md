The Hadal Tap is an ancient pumping system from a previous [[Cycle|cycle]] that surfaces water for drinking in [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/La Peiza/index|La Peiza]]. It was infected with a chaos beast that had emerged from below, but an adventuring party defeated the beast, cleaning the water.

Below the tap is a monitoring station partially constructed in a dream, with an interface for a [[Kaathe]] orb. The monitoring station was constructed partially from the SSV Trip the Light Fantastic.

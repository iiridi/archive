A former [[Aeternalis]] mining town on the northern part of the gulch. Tragedy struck the region when all of the aeternalis ignited, engulfing the town and outlying area in everburning green flame. [[Ezekiel Grimm|Grimm]] claims to have caused the ignition himself, to punish the town for its heresy.

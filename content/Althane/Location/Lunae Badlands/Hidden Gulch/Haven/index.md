Haven is the most prosperous city in the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/index|Gulch]] -- the only one with an open supply of water, wood and food. It's led by [[Ezekiel Grimm|Reverend Grimm]], the patriarch of the [[Church of the Thirteenth Realm]].

It's said that before Grimm arrived the area was a desolate wasteland but he manifested a lake surrounded by a forest for his followers to have a safe haven from the dangers of the gulch. Suspended at the entrance to the city is a lit chunk of [[Aeternalis]]; followers of the church claim that it's the first one to have been created by Grimm.

Pilgrims from across the gulch travel to live in Haven, where they're greeted with open arms by the locals. However, the rail companies are all on bad terms with Haven and Grimm, and attempts to build railways to the city are often thwarted to violent effect.

The city's sigil is a crescent moon below a perfect circle.

Junction is a mining town located in the center of the [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/index|gulch]]. Rails from all three rail companies pass through the town, and the most direct route to [[Althane/Location/Lunae Badlands/Hidden Gulch/Haven/index|Haven]] is a straight-shot south.

Junction was originally just a set of mines built into the canyon walls, but as more people arrived from across the gulch it expanded -- both outward and upward, carving its way right into the cliff face. Nowadays the town is one of the largest population centers for miles, and is considered the center for [[Aeternalis]] trade.

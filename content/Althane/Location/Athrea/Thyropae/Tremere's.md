Tremere's is the premiere trading company operating out of [[Althane/Location/Athrea/Thyropae/index|Thyropae]], and the only major trading company in [[Althane/Location/Athrea/index|Athrea]] that's been able to repel [[Alter and Associates|A&A]]'s attempts to buy or strong-arm them out of the business.

Unbeknown to most, however, is that Tremere's is run by a [[Althane/Organization/Vampire Cabal/index|Vampire Cabal]] (the [[Tremere Cabal]]).
